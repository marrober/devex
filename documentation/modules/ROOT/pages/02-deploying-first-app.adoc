== *Deploying an Application to OpenShift*

====
*What will you learn?*

This module will introduce you to the concepts of *applications* from the perspective of deploying them on OpenShift. 

This application already exists as a Docker Image; this module will walk you through the steps to execute it as an application. 

After completing the module you will understand the concepts of an application and how to instantiate one with OpenShift.
====

=== Pre-Requisites

In order to undertake the module you need to be logged onto the cluster and have access to a project.

Ensure that the two text boxes at the top of page contain the Cluster address provided by the workshop facilitators and the project you have been assigned. Remember to press *RETURN* after entering text into each field.

=== Creating the Application

OpenShift provides two *perspectives* within the User Interface. The first is *Administrator*, which gives you a comprehensive overview of the Objects and Components to which you have access.

The second is the *Developer* viewpoint, which we will use extensively during this module.

If you haven't already logged on, log on to the Bootcamp cluster at:

https://console-openshift-console.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%[role='params-link',window='_blank']

What we are going to do is create an Application from a pre-built image, hosted on the internal OpenShift image registry. +

Switch the viewpoint to Developer (Top left pulldown). 

[NOTE]
====
The Developer viewpoint is an opinionated interface for application developers, containing all the components you need to develop and configure your applications
====

==== Creating your project

Select the 'Topology' view on the left hand side of the screen and you will be shown a screen similar to that which is shown below. This indicates that you currently do not have any projects. You need to create a new project specifically for you to isolate your work from other people attending the workshop.

image::02-01-no-projects.png[Topology view with no projects]

Click on the blue hyperlink 'Create a new project' within the blue box with the title "Getting Started". Create a new project with the name :

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
%PROJECT%
----

You can leave the 'Display name' and description empty or add something descriptive if you wish.

==== Creating the application

Once the project has been created select Add+ from the left hand side menu.

From the options provided, click on *Container Images.*

You will be provided with a wizard template for creating an Application from an existing contaier image. In order to do this we need to have an existing prebuilt image, which is available at:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
quay.io/marrober/bootcamp-app:1
----

Copy the contents of the field above and paste it into the text area beneath *Image name from external registry* which should be selected by default (if it is not, select this option before pasting the target image location in).

[NOTE]
====
When we complete this form the image from that repository will be used to construct an application pod container the selected container image.
You can create applications directly from any image that you can see within an accessible registry. OpenShift has its own registry internally from which images will be served; even when pulling a container from an external registry it will be pulled into the integrated registry first, making the integrated registry a source of truth for the entire cluster.
====

Once you have entered the container image URL you should get a message saying *Validated* displayed beneath the textbox; this indicates that the Image exists at the target location and OpenShift is able to access it. Some image registries require a user authentication process before images can be pulled. 

*Optional* - Feel free to choose a Runtime Icon for the application from the pulldown; this will be displayed on the topology when the Application is created. It defaults to an OpenShift logo.

[NOTE]
====
In the *General* part of the form there are two pulldown boxes; "Application" and "Name". Think of an "Application" in this context is a semantic grouping of containers that have an aligned function, this being the "Application." This grouping of individual Applications, allows you to perform high-level tasks on them. 
====
Set the *Application* field to *devex-app*.

The *Name* field is more important. This defines the name/label that is applied to all the Objects needed to manifest your Application. Set the *Name* field to *devex*

[TIP]
====
It's actually useful that all the component objects for the Application, of different types, have the same name. +
It makes it easy to find and interact with them.
====

In the *Advanced Options* part of the form we have the extra bits that allow you to highly configure the application. For this example we are simply going to create a *Route*. The additional advanced options include adding Environment Variables, which we will cover in the module 'Using environement variables', Health Checks, Scaling, Resource Limits and Labels.

[NOTE]
====
*Labels* are a very important concept within OpenShift. They provide an extensible way of adding contextual information to the Objects that make up the Application, and can be used for filtering, determining how and where the Application is deployed and a lot more.
====

For now create the first Application; click on *Create* to start the process.

The OpenShift UI will now take you to the topology to show your Application being deployed. Depending on the speed of your connection this should be reasonably fast; you will see an empty roundel containing the icon you chose (the outer ring will be white). This will change to light blue while the Container is being deployed, and then to a dark blue to indicate the Container is active and the Application has been deployed.

You know have an Application active on OpenShift. Click on the Roundel itself and the topology page should look very similar to this:

image::002-image003.png[Topology View]

The side panel on the right gives a detailed set of information about the Application. In this case, on the *Resources* tab, it shows the component objects that make up the Application. These consist of *Pods*, *Services* and *Routes*.

=== *Trying out the Application*

*TODO* change if we're using loom app or dev terminal for this lab

The Application itself is a web-based application that provides a Terminal running in a webpage that has the command line, *oc*, for interacting with OpenShift. 

To start the Application either click on the small 'Route' icon at the top right of the Roundel, or click on the Roundel itself (if the right-hand panel isn't visible) and then click the link shown in the *Resources* tab (look at the *Routes* information and click on the 'Location' link).

The Application should pop up in a new tab. In the new window type *oc help* - this should display the help commands for the oc command line.

[TIP]
====
You can interact directly with OpenShift using the 'oc' command line tool as well. Normally this requires you to install this locally; instructions would have been provided by the D2S team. +
Put simply the 'oc' command gives you create, read, update and delete access to all the Objects you own in the Projects you can access. You can do anything using 'oc' that you can do using the UI, the UI is an opinionated, easy to use wrapper around the same OpenShift RESTful calls that are done through the command line.
====

=== *Further Exercises*

These are completely optional but give you a chance to explore the concepts of the module.

*Using 'oc' create another copy of the Application with a different name*

[TIP]
====
Use 'oc help' to work out which command. Also, use the 'Copy Login Command' from the pulldown at the top right of the UI, where your login name is displayed, to log the oc client on correctly from the Application itself.
