== Directly modifying container configuration
====
*What will you learn?*

This module will introduce you to the correct way to manage container configuration.

You will learn how to ensure that containers (and the pods in which they run) are configured correctly.

After completing the module you will understand how to configure running containers.
====

=== *Pre-Requisites*

In order to undertake the module you need to be logged onto the cluster and have access to a project. The project will have been created in a prior exercise. The application to which the environment variables will be added will also have been created in a prior exercise.

Ensure that the two text boxes at the top of page contain the Cluster address provided by the workshop facilitators and the project you have been assigned. Remember to press *RETURN* after entering text into each field.

== Modifying the container configuration

In the last section you created two environment variables on a deployment which was subsequently propogated to the pods created by the deployment. If you look at the pod definition in the web user interface you can see the environment variables that have been applied to the pod, as shown below.

As you can see above these environment variables are greyed out because they are managed by a parent entity which in this case is the deployment where the environment variables were added. Having a knowledge of this hierarchy is important so that you know what you can change, and where.

There are other ways that we can have an impact on the pods, however, such as the terminal.

From the topology view of the OpenShift web user interface select the deployment icon. From the pop out menu on the right hand side of the screen select the pod and then from the pod sub-menu select terminal. These steps are shown graphically below :

=== Step 1 - Select the application on the developer topology view.

=== Step 2 - Select the pod on and view the pod specific menu.

=== Step 3 - Select the terminal menu.

Within the terminal view enter the command :

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
printenv | grep VAR
----

Any changes made to the environment variables within the pod will cause confusion because the single source of truth should remain the deployment resource. Additionally, most applications only read environment variables at startup so any changes will not be picked up until the application restarts. If we restart the pod to restart the application then the enviromment variables will be read from the parent deployment again and the changes made to the pod directly will be lost.

The environment variables applied to the pod will show up in the pod yaml file as shown in the snippet below.

[.console-input]
[source]
----
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: bootcampapp-git-8c67fb5c8-4fch5
  namespace: test
  labels:
    app: bootcampapp-git
    deploymentconfig: bootcampapp-git
    pod-template-hash: 8c67fb5c8
spec:
  restartPolicy: Always
  containers:
      name: bootcampapp-git
      env:
        - name: VAR1
          value: Barcelona
        - name: VAR2
          value: Paris
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 8443
          protocol: TCP
      imagePullPolicy: Always
----

== Summary

While you can view environment variables from the pod directly these should not be modified in any way. If any change is required to the configuration of a running pod then the source of that configuration should be changed.
